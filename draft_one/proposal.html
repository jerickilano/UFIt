                <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                <p>Our area of interest is the general exercise and fitness space. Exercise is very important for human health, however many people tend to skip exercising daily due to the inconvenience it may cause to fit in a workout into their daily routine. We will seek to address this issue by first discovering why exactly people tend to find working out inconveneient. This happens for a number of reasons. Some of the issues we have found is that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People may not know where to begin if they are new to working out</li>
                    <li>People may need motivation to workout consistently</li>
                    <li>People may get tired of their workouts and need new things to try</li>
                </ul>
                <p> This leads to the main information technology problem within this space. There is currently no platform that allows for users to learn about workouts based on their personal goals, while accounting for all types of users whether they are just beginning to workout or are more advanced and are looking for new workouts.</p>
                <p>There have been many applications created to address this issue for those looking to workout. One example is <a href="https://www.fitnesspointapp.com">Fitness Point</a>. The main issue with these past attempts was that these applications were tailored towards specific types of workouts or specific people instead of being general and useful to those looking to try different types of workouts. Although these applications provide feautres such as the ability to log workouts or find new exercises, they are not created for all levels of experience with working out, and they contain content specific for a type of workout, such as running or lifting, rather than containing all types of exercises.</p>
